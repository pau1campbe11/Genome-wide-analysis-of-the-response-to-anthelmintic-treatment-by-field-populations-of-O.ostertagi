#Concatenate the reference genomes 
The pooled populations of gastrointestinal nematodes are composed of ~99% of out species of interest Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora, they could not be split into seperate species populations pools before sequencing, therefore a pan-genome of both species needs to be created to align to, so that there is no minimise miss-alignment and alignment bias.
