# Alignment of *O.* *ostertagi* to *H.* *contortus* genome assembly 

This document describes the execution of **PROmer** (from the MUMmer package) to perform protein-level genome alignment between *Haemonchus contortus* and *Ostertagia ostertagi*. PROmer aligns translated nucleotide sequences, improving sensitivity for divergent genomes.
